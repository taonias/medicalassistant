/// <summary>
/// How a Document is identified in the store: the id every chunk is stamped
/// with, the patient document list is keyed by, and un-ingest addresses.
///
/// It lives in one place because those features have to agree exactly. A list
/// that names documents the delete endpoint cannot find would be worse than no
/// list at all.
///
/// Each Document Type declares what makes it unique, and the whole key is carried
/// in the id rather than merely alongside it because the id travels alone:
/// <c>DELETE /documents/{documentId}</c> receives nothing else. A transcript is
/// keyed by doctor, patient, session and sequence number; a note by doctor,
/// patient and noteId. An id naming only a session would be safe to act on only
/// if session ids were known to be unique across patients — and they are not — so
/// carrying the whole key makes the identifier answer "whose document is this?"
/// by itself, instead of depending on a property of the backend nobody confirmed.
///
/// This is the single per-type identity expression the store matches on. The same
/// id decides what a Correction replaces, so every query that asks "is this the
/// same document?" compares this string — never the raw nullable columns, whose
/// EF-rewritten both-null equality would make two session-less notes look like one
/// document (bug B09). Those queries live in <see cref="IngestionStore" />:
/// in-flight detection, duplicate detection, the staleness check on rerun, and
/// supersede.
