# Ingestion Pipeline — Design Record

Outcome of the design interviews, 2026-07-12 (initial transcript pipeline + multi-document expansion). Terminology: [CONTEXT.md](../CONTEXT.md). Load-bearing decisions: [docs/adr/](adr/).

## What is being built

A .NET 10 web service that ingests clinical Documents into Postgres + pgvector so a future RAG chat can answer a doctor's questions about a patient. Four Document Types: **SessionTranscript**, **DoctorNote**, **LabReport**, **ImagingReport**. Scope of this design: **ingestion and un-ingestion only** — the chat/retrieval side is future work.

## System boundary

- The **existing backend** is the only caller, authenticated by a **shared API secret** sent as a request header (the SignalR hub handshake presents the same secret). There are no user tokens: **user context (doctorId, patientId, …) travels explicitly in each request payload**, and authorization (which doctor may do what) is the backend's responsibility — this service fully trusts its one caller. Erasure is guarded by a **separate admin secret**. Secrets live in the estate's secret store; validation supports two active keys so rotation is zero-downtime. Concretely: the header is `X-Api-Key`, and the valid secrets are configured at `Authentication:ApiKeys` (an array — hold two while rotating). The service refuses to start with none configured, so it can never come up unprotected. Swagger UI itself stays reachable without the secret: it publishes the contract, not data. The **doctor's phone app never talks to this service** — uploads, status, document lists, and un-ingest requests are all backend-mediated.
- Status flows: this service → SignalR hub → existing backend (the one trusted hub client) → backend's own channel to the app. Events are stamped with `doctorId`; the backend does the fan-out.
- This service **stores raw document payloads** (retry + rerun + audit + provenance need them) → it is a system of record for PHI and inherits the estate's encryption-at-rest/backup rules. Flagged to compliance owner.

## Document types

| Type | Arrives as | Identity | Strategy shape |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SessionTranscript | Inline free-text transcript | (`sessionId`, `sequenceNumber`) | LLM semantic chunking (boundaries-only, line-based) + blurbs + summary → embed → store |
| DoctorNote | Inline text, optional `sessionId` link | `noteId` (backend-assigned; edit = Correction) | Same prose pipeline as transcripts (monologue mode) |
| LabReport | Digitally generated PDF (base64, size-capped), many lab layouts | Backend-assigned document id + content-hash dedup | Document Intelligence → Renditions (Tier 1) + Analyte Results (Tier 2) |
| ImagingReport | PDF of radiologist's findings + link to image | Backend-assigned document id + content-hash dedup | Document Intelligence text → prose pipeline; image link rides as chunk metadata. Pixels never ingested (ADR-0005) |

Scanned/handwritten documents (no text layer) are **out of scope** — no OCR path exists; re-entry point in ADR-0005.

## Contract

`POST /ingestions` — one endpoint, `documentType` as discriminator, per-type payload validation:

```json
{
  "documentType": "SessionTranscript",
  "doctorId": "…", "patientId": "…",
  "sessionId": "…", "sequenceNumber": 1,
  "sessionDate": "2026-07-10T14:30:00Z", "language": "el",
  "transcript": "Doctor: Good morning…\nPatient: I keep waking up with headaches…"
}
```

`DoctorNote` carries `noteId` + `text` (+ optional `sessionId`); `LabReport`/`ImagingReport` carry base64 `pdfContent` + document id (+ `imageLink` for imaging).

- Returns `202` + `ingestionId`. `409` if the same document identity is already Queued/Processing.
- Identical content hash + prior success → no-op (`duplicate: true`), **whatever identity it arrives under**. The hash covers what the document is — type, patient, doctor, clinical date, language, content — but not `sessionId`/`sequenceNumber`, which are filing rather than content. So the same recording re-uploaded as a new session or a fresh sequence number is skipped instead of duplicating knowledge in the patient's record, while the same text for a *different* patient is ingested normally. Identical content + prior failure → retry of that same ingestion.
- Same identity + different content → **Correction**: one transaction deletes the previous version's chunks, writes the new ones, and marks the previous ingestion `Superseded`. That status is load-bearing, not cosmetic — a replaced ingestion holds no chunks, so leaving it `Completed` would let dedup answer "already ingested" about deleted text and silently drop a re-upload of the original. New `sequenceNumber` on an existing session, with different content → **Continuation**.

- `POST /ingestions/{id}/retry` reruns a **Failed** ingestion from its stored payload — the whole pipeline, no checkpoints — and restores its attempt budget, so a document that exhausted its automatic attempts is still recoverable once the cause is fixed. Only Failed is rerunnable; anything else is `409`.

Full surface:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /ingestions` | Submit a Document |
| `GET /ingestions/{id}` | Status of one ingestion |
| `GET /ingestions?doctorId=…&active=true` | Backfill/resync for the relay (REST is source of truth; SignalR events are a hint to look) |
| `POST /ingestions/{id}/retry` | Re-run a Failed ingestion (raw payload is stored) |
| `GET /patients/{patientId}/documents` | Ingested-documents view for the doctor's app |
| `DELETE /documents/{documentId}` | **Un-ingest**: removes chunks + analyte rows + payload; Ingestion record survives as a `Deleted` audit tombstone (who/what/when). Canonical case: wrong-patient upload |
| `DELETE /patients/{patientId}/data` | **Erasure** (GDPR, requires the separate admin secret): purges everything for a patient including tombstones and payloads; the erasure act itself is logged irreversibly |
| `/hubs/ingestion-status` | SignalR hub the backend subscribes to |

## Processing model

- POST → persist Ingestion row (`Queued`) → in-process `Channel` → N `BackgroundService` workers (config, default ~4; real ceiling is Azure OpenAI rate limits).
- Recovery re-enqueues non-terminal ingestions — at startup and on a timer thereafter (`Ingestion:RecoverySweepInterval`, default 5 min), because the instance that abandons work is not always the instance that has to notice. Abandoned means unfinished *and* holding no advisory lock, which a dying process releases with its database session; there is no lease and no timeout. Attempt counter (max 3) prevents poison loops, and a claim refuses any ingestion that is no longer non-terminal.
- No cross-document ordering; only same-identity concurrency is blocked (the 409).
- The **Orchestrator** is a deterministic registry lookup `documentType → IngestionStrategy` (ADR-0004). Strategies are plain sequential C# stages; AI lives inside stages as MAF `ChatClientAgent`s behind `IChatClient`/`IEmbeddingGenerator` (day one: Azure OpenAI EU, `gpt-4.1-mini` + `text-embedding-3-large`; provider is config, not architecture).
- **Agent instructions come from the database** (ADR-0008): an `agent_instructions` table (name → instructions → **version**) seeded by an EF Core migration (no runtime code copy of the prompt text), loaded once at application start into a singleton provider that strategies use to build their agents. Prompt changes apply on restart, no redeploy. Every ingestion records the instruction version and chat model that processed it, so quality regressions are traceable to the prompt that caused them and selectively re-ingestable. Safety is unaffected — the code-side guardrails (boundary validation, verbatim verification) enforce the output contract regardless of prompt wording.
- Every ingestion is **atomic** (ADR-0003): nothing visible until the final single Postgres transaction (delete superseded chunks/rows + insert + `Completed`); crash/retry = rerun from scratch.

## Strategies

**SessionTranscript** — validate/persist → chunk+enrich (one structured-output agent call: line-index ranges over the numbered transcript Lines + Context Blurb per chunk + Transcript Summary; code assembles verbatim text from the pointed-at Lines, validates boundaries, enforces ~200–600-token targets / 800 hard max; one corrective retry then `Failed` — no degraded fallback, ADR-0002) → batched embed (blurb + verbatim text) → atomic store (summary embedded as its own chunk).

**DoctorNote** — same prose pipeline; input is monologue text instead of dialog; supersede on `noteId` re-POST.

**LabReport** — validate/persist → Document Intelligence layout extraction (text + table cell grids) → **Tier 1:** deterministic Rendition per Panel (code renders "Hemoglobin: 13.2 g/dL (ref 13.5–17.5, LOW)…" — one chunk per Panel, never per analyte) → **Tier 2:** analyte mapping (LLM classifies columns + canonical names; code copies values from the cells the LLM pointed at; verbatim verification per row — ADR-0006) → embed Renditions → atomic store of chunks + analyte rows.
Failure policy ("tiered honesty"): Tier 1 must succeed or the ingestion is `Failed`; Tier 2 rows are all-or-nothing — any unverifiable row stores zero rows and sets `analytesExtracted: false` (queryable, re-processable). Trend queries never see a partial Panel.

**ImagingReport** — Document Intelligence text extraction → prose pipeline (chunks + blurbs + summary) → every chunk carries the `imageLink` in `sourceRef`.

## Chunk metadata spine

The common core every chunk carries, designed once because reshaping a populated vector table is the migration that hurts. Type-specific data hangs off `sourceRef`; the parent column is `documentId`, never `transcriptId`.

| Field | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `patientId` | The universal retrieval filter and security boundary |
| `doctorId` | Access scoping, audit |
| `documentType` | Filter/weight by kind ("check her labs") |
| `documentId` | Cascade-delete target; provenance to source |
| `ingestionId` | Which run produced this chunk |
| `documentDate` | Clinical date (session/collection date), not upload time — powers "last X-ray" |
| `language` | `el`/`en` |
| `chunkKind` | `dialog` / `summary` / `note` / `labPanel` / `imagingReport` |
| `sourceRef` (nullable) | Line range / PDF page / image link |
| `sessionId` (nullable) | Transcripts and session-linked notes only |
| `embeddingModel` | Which model produced the vector — the write/read contract. Recording it per chunk makes an embedding-model change a managed re-embedding migration instead of silent search corruption; startup guards dimensions against config |

**Analyte Result rows** (relational, beside the vector table): `canonicalName`, `verbatimName`, value, unit, reference range, flag, collection date, `documentId`, provenance (page/table/row). Exist for trend queries vector search cannot answer.

## Status model

Persisted: `Queued → Processing → Completed | Failed | Deleted` (tombstone). Stage detail rides on SignalR events: `{ ingestionId, doctorId, state, stage, message }` (stages per strategy, e.g. `Chunking | Embedding | Storing`, `Extracting | Mapping | Embedding | Storing`). `Failed` records error category + message. Transient faults (429s/timeouts) retry inside stages with backoff (Polly) and never surface as states.

## Deferred — deliberately out of scope, with re-entry points

| Deferred | Re-entry point |
| --- | --- |
| Structured clinical-fact extraction from dialog (medications, conditions, symptoms, follow-ups) | New stage + agent in the transcript strategy; schema + mandatory provenance sketched in interview Q7. Unlike lab analytes, this is generative extraction — the full guardrail debate applies |
| Windowing for oversized documents (transcript too big for one chunking call) | Two-level pattern: deterministically pre-split into bounded windows with stable line offsets, then semantic chunking within/between windows. Never let the LLM see unbounded input; never invent this ad hoc under pressure |
| OCR for scanned/handwritten documents | Document Intelligence supports it; re-validate quality per ADR-0005 before opening scope |
| LOINC (or similar) coding of analytes | Additive on `canonicalName` (ADR-0006) |
| Session-level artifacts (rolling session summary) | Would force per-session ordering — rejected; revisit only with the feature |
| Message broker | Replace the Channel; Ingestion table already durable |
| Stage checkpointing | Rejected as premature (ADR-0003); reconsider only with volume evidence |
| Classifier agent for untyped documents | Front stage with confidence threshold + human fallback (ADR-0004) |
| Blob storage for payloads | Only if PDFs outgrow Postgres `bytea` comfort (a few MB is fine) |

## Open items (not design, but must happen)

- Compliance sign-off: Azure OpenAI **and Document Intelligence** EU-region processing of patient data; encryption-at-rest/backup rules for the new Postgres DB; retention policy for `Deleted` tombstones.
- Provision the two API secrets (standard + admin) in the estate's secret store and agree the rotation procedure with the backend team (dual active keys, ADR-0007).
- Per-lab extraction quality: spot-check Document Intelligence + analyte mapping against real PDFs from each lab provider before trusting Tier 2 (a golden-PDF test set per provider).
- Observability when building: structured logs per stage with `ingestionId` correlation, OpenTelemetry traces around LLM/embedding/Document Intelligence calls, counters by outcome + duration + `analytesExtracted`.
- Testing: golden-transcript and golden-PDF integration tests through the real pipeline with fake `IChatClient`; contract tests for boundary validation and verbatim verification.
